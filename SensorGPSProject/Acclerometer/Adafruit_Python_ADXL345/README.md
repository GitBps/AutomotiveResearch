# DEPRECATED LIBRARY. Adafruit Python ADXL345

This library has been deprecated! We are leaving this up for historical and research purposes but archiving the repository.

We are now only supporting the use of our CircuitPython libraries for use with Python.

Check out the [Adafruit CircuitPython ADXL34x library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_CircuitPython_ADXL34x).

## Adafruit Python ADXL345
Python code to use the ADXL345 triple-axis accelerometer over I2C with a Raspberry Pi or BeagleBone Black.

## Installation

To install the library from source (recommended) run the following commands on a Raspberry Pi or other Debian-based OS system:

    sudo apt-get install git build-essential python-dev
    cd ~
    git clone https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_Python_ADXL345.git
    cd Adafruit_Python_ADXL345
    sudo python setup.py install

Alternatively you can install from pip with:

    sudo pip install adafruit-adxl345

Note that the pip install method **won't** install the example code.
